/**
 * The reason for URL format versioning is because in the future we might completely change the way we serialize state to the URL
 * For instance, maybe the amount of data needed to be persisted grows behind any advisable size, so we'll have to provide a stronger compression
 * At that point, we might choose to replace JSURL with something else
 * However, our users could still have the old link bookmarked accessible from some old email
 * That's why we need version, as a separate link variable
 * By reading the version first, and then applying a query deserialization for that version, we're ensuring backward compatibility
 * Once we eventually start using de/serializer version 2, the old deserializer (but not the serializer) should still be in our codebase,
 * and there should be a switch..case on the version, for using the right deserializer
