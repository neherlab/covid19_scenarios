COVID-19 Scenarios is a tool that allows to explore the dynamics of a COVID-19 outbreak in a given community and to
assess the associated burden on the healthcare system. COVID-19 Scenarios, as every other model, it has parameters whose
values are not known with certainty, which might differ between places and change with time. The values of some of these
of these parameters have a major effect on the results.

The results are particularly sensitive to parameters that determine how rapidly the disease spreads or how effective
counter-measures are: some values will result in a small limited outbreak, others in a massive outbreak with many
fatalities. Furthermore, when extrapolating the outbreak into the future, the results will critically depend on
assumptions of **future** policy and the degree to which infection control measures are adhered to. It is therefore
important to interpret the model output with care and to assess the plausibility of the parameter values and model
assumptions.

COVID-19 Scenarios uses an age-structured generalized SEIR model. For details, please consult the documentation on
[covid19-scenarios.org/about](https://covid19-scenarios.org/about). Default parameter choices are informed by the
available evidence at the time, but might need adjustment for a particular community or as more information on the
outbreak is available.
